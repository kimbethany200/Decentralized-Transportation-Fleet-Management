# Decentralized Transportation Fleet Management System

This project implements a blockchain-based solution for managing transportation fleets in a decentralized manner. By leveraging smart contracts, it provides transparency, immutability, and enhanced security for critical fleet operations.

## Core Components

The system consists of five primary smart contracts:

1. **Vehicle Registration Contract**: Maintains a comprehensive registry of all transportation assets in the fleet, including ownership details, vehicle specifications, and operational status.

2. **Driver Verification Contract**: Manages the verification and validation of driver credentials, certifications, and performance records to ensure only qualified operators access fleet vehicles.

3. **Maintenance Tracking Contract**: Records all maintenance activities, schedules service requirements, and maintains the complete service history for each vehicle in the fleet.

4. **Route Optimization Contract**: Stores and manages optimal delivery routes, tracks historical route performance, and provides data for continuous route improvement.

5. **Fuel Management Contract**: Monitors fuel consumption, identifies efficiency patterns, and helps optimize fuel usage across the fleet.

## Benefits

- **Immutable Record-Keeping**: All fleet data is stored on the blockchain, creating tamper-proof records.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: All stakeholders have visibility into relevant fleet operations.
- **Automated Compliance**: Smart contracts can enforce regulatory and company policy compliance.
- **Decentralized Management**: Reduces single points of failure in fleet management systems.
- **Secure Data Sharing**: Enables selective, permissioned access to sensitive fleet information.

## Getting Started

Detailed documentation for each contract is available in their respective directories. The project uses [blockchain technology] and requires [specific development environment] to deploy and interact with the contracts.
